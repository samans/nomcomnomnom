# Executive Summary
* There are many years of experience with the NomCom process in this room
* There are many years of community feedback related to the functioning of NomCom
* Start the update of RFC7437bis once the IASA 2.0 update is finished

* Following are pointers to the background information I have found.
	* Please send updates or additions!
* Some Next Steps follow

# Job One
* What do we want to call this merry band of heroes?

* Old NomCom Chairs (onc)
* Weeping Angels (don’t blink)
	* Bad Wolf works for me too
* Cat Herding and other systems (Chaos)

* Need a sweet cool name because the work will probably cause severe stomach pain and pounding headaches.

# Collected Wisdom (NomCom Related)
* Brian Carpenter From 2018 and 2019

* Peter Yee
	* The mid-term replacement process in RFC 7437 is tough.  I don't know how often it has been run, but it really leaves little room for error or variation.  This might be something to revise so that future NomComs have more flexibility should it be needed.
	* The questionnaire is really long.  I know that some voters like more information, but it's a burden on nominees that can have the downside of discouraging some from accepting a nomination.

# NomCom Plenary Updates
* IETF 104 (2018-2019)
	* [slides-104-ietf-sessa-ietf-104-nomcom-update-00] (https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/104/materials/slides-104-ietf-sessa-ietf-104-nomcom-update-00)
	* No process guidance	
* IETF 101 (2017-2018)
	* [slides-101-ietf-sessb-nomcom-2017-2018-00] (https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/101/materials/slides-101-ietf-sessb-nomcom-2017-2018-00)
	* Areas of Weakness:
		* Some Areas have very small leadership pools – we said this last year and it’s even more true this year.
		* Employer support – perhaps an earlier call for nominees will give more time to line up that support.

# NomCom Plenary Updates (cont...)
* IETF 98 (2016-2017)
	* [slides-98-ietf-sessc-nomcom-report-00] (https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/98/materials/slides-98-ietf-sessc-nomcom-report-00 )
	* Areas of Weakness:
		* Some Areas have very small leadership pools
		* Employer support for participation
		* Clear and distinct position descriptions
	* RFC Updates may be Needed:
		* The composition of the IESG has changed
		* We need to document the process for filling a vacancy created by IESG to IESG reassignments
	* Accounting for Remote Participation
* IETF 95 (2015-2016)
	* [slides-95-ietf-plenary-6] (https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/95/materials/slides-95-ietf-plenary-6)
	* No process guidance

# NomCom Plenary Updates (cont...)
* IETF 92 (2014-2015)
	* [slides-92-iesg-opsplenary-9] (https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/92/materials/slides-92-iesg-opsplenary-9)
	* Challenge
		* Email. DMARC has caused problems.
			* Nomcom2015 members might need @ietf.org mailboxes.
		* I consider this to be an admission of defeat, and a withdrawal to a walled (smtp) garden.
	* The nomcom essentially winds up acting as an18 month in performance review of IESG/IAD people (IAOC too)
	* The nomcom is not a particularly good tool for getting constructive feedback.
		* 18 months in is too late; no real time to react/fix in a way that the community can see improvement.
		* Confidentiality makes it easy to get back, but hard to act on it well. 
* IETF 89 (2013-2014)
	* [slides-89-iesg-opsplenary-1] (https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/89/materials/slides-89-iesg-opsplenary-1 )
	* Recommendation 1: continue registration checkbox +confirmation, and whatever else works! 
	* Recommendation 2: “interview consistency procedures” 
		* Template
		* Roles: Lead, Scribe, Observers (at least two)
	* Recommendation 3: orange t-shirts and hats
	* Recommendation 4: Alternate (11th) member selected who participates but only becomes voting if a voting member is removed.

	* Appoint the NomCom chair early (This issue seems to have been addressed)

# Review of IETF mail list (recent)
* Some issues I found by searching the IETF mail list

* NomCom RFC Updating:
	* [NomCom RFC Updating] (https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf/pBKnRwTgGktte7RgVHqJyDcrdHY)
* Voting in NomCom:
	* [NomCom Voting] (https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf/syCCh2rq1uuJP3T2_CNECHNCMd8)

# Other things I’ve heard/noticed
* Remote Participants
	* As NomCom Voting Members
	* How to validate “attendance” or what criteria to use (the 3 out of 5 in-person attendance is not applicable)
* Meeting Venues
	* Holding the interviews in meetings in Asia
* Doing debriefs for both successful and unsuccessful nominees (providing feedback from the NomCom to the nominees) is very popular (but not discussed in the RFC)
* The NomCom voting member pool is still painful to create and validate
* A template calendar would be useful
* Templates for Announcements would be useful

# Thoughts about Way Forward
* Review all material
* Include references to material I missed
* Brainstorm for more areas to improve
* Create a list of categories to help organize the input
* Identify hot areas to work on first
* Deep Breath
* Rinse, Repeat
* Build an I-D to capture material and to help drive the discussion

# Thanks (for now)!
