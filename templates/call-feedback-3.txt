
Keep up the great work!  The NomCom has received a great deal of feedback on 
the nominees.  The community feedback figures prominently in our deliberations
and helps the Voting NomCom members choose the best nominees!

Ask: Feedback for IAB, IETF Chair, and IESG Area Directors

The feedback period for the IAB, IETF Chair and IESG ADs closes on 16 November!

The 2018-19 Nominating Committee has collected a list of willing candidates
for the positions open this cycle.  You can see the list at
https://datatracker.ietf.org/nomcom/2018/feedback/

You may provide feedback using the web form there; it is secure.  All web
feedback goes into the datatracker using asymmetric encryption, which is then
decrypted by the NomCom members as they read it.  Your feedback can not be
seen by the secretariat, the tools people, or any of the management.

Your feedback through the web form is not anonymous when shown to NomCom
members as you need an IETF login to provide it.

If you want to give truly anonymous feedback, please contact one of the
NomCom members that you trust directly, and ask him/her to relay the feedback
anonymously to the NomCom.

You can also submit feedback via email to nomcom-chair-2018 at ietf.org and
I will enter it in the datatracker. One email per candidate, please. Please
indicate if I should share your identity with the full NomCom.

NomCom Office hours in Bangkok are:

Or send an email to me and we can schedule some time.

time taken to submit it.
