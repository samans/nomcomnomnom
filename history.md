		* The role of term limits as a selection criterion was clarified.
		* The nominating committee must now be provided with a brief description of the desirable expertise for each candidate to be nominated for each position.
		* Because of the overlapping terms of successive nominating committees, the specific committee responsible for a mid-term vacancy was specified.
		* The characterization of the advice and consent model was revised to permit the confirming body to communicate with the nominating committee during the approval process.
		* A general rule was added to define that all announcements are made with the usual IETF Secretariat mechanism.
		* Details regarding the expected timeline of the selection and operation of the committee were made even more explicit.  An Appendix was added that captures all the details for the convenience of the reader.
		* The term of the nominating committee was extended to approximately 15 months such that it explicitly overlaps by approximately 3 months the next year's nominating committee's term.
		* The terms voting member and non-voting member were replaced by voting volunteers, liaisons, and advisors.  All members vote at all times except that only voting volunteers vote on a candidate selection.
		* The responsibilities of the Chair, liaisons, advisors, and voting volunteers is now explicitly stated.
		* Processes for recalling members of the committee were added.
		* Liaisons and advisors are no longer required to meet the usual requirements for nominating committee membership.
		* The Internet Society Board of Trustees may appoint a non-voting liaison.
		* The eligibility qualifications for the nominating committee were changed to require attendance at 3 out of 5 of the last five meetings, to require volunteers to submit identifying contact information, and to request that volunteers be familiar with IETF processes and procedures.
		* Some additional clarification was added to the method used to select volunteers.
		* The process for selecting the 10 voting volunteers had several clarifications and additional requirements added, including a challenge process and the requirement to disallow more than two volunteers with the same primary affiliation.

		* The responsibility and authority for the activities of the nominating committee rests with the committee as a whole, not with the Chair.  The operation of the committee was clarified to require changes in process and the handling of exceptions to be approved by the committee as a whole as opposed to being at the discretion of the Chair.
		* The rule that prevented nominating committee members from being eligible to be considered for any open position was clarified to explicitly state that the rule applies from the point in time that the committee membership is announced through the entire term of the current committee.
