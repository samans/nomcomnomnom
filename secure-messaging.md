# Secure Messaging
* Guidelines and Requirements
	* Support encryption for all messages end-to-end and any attachments being sent
	* encryption done in a way that is invisible to the user
	* Easy to Use (common messaging platform interaction)
	* Support multiple devices
	* Support group-chat
	* No server-based retention
* [Secure Messaging Apps] (https://www.securemessagingapps.com/)
* The above link provides a comparison of 12 secure messaging tools
* Three of the tools are viable for a trial run (Support all items in the requirements list above)
	* [Signal] (https://www.signal.org/)
	* [Threema] (https://threema.ch/en/)
	* [Wire] (https://wire.com/en/)
		* Wire Personal may be all we need
* Questions to answer
	* Is there a cost to using the service?
		* We have 18 users, and most likely a user group that will access the service on more than one device.
	* Can we use the personal versions or do we need a "business/enterprise" capabilities
	* Are people willing to use this type of platform in lieu of an email list?
* Testing
	* I have wire installed and can be found @scott_mansfield_nom19 (Scott Mansfield)
		* I have tested a group chat called NomCom 19-20
	* I have signal installed and can be found +1 724 931 9316
	* I have not installed Threema, but have seen it and it has a similar profile
